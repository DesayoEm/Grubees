I'm building a social recipe-sharing app to get comfortable with writing RESTful APIs in Python. It will feature image handling, user auth, and search functionality.

PHASE 1 (Core Foundation):

User basics: registration, auth, profiles
Basic post CRUD
Single image per post
Basic text search by name
Simple categories
Basic social: likes, comments, viewing public posts
Public/private post controls





Phase 2 (Enhanced Platform):

Multiple images per post
Advanced search with tags/hashtags
Collections/saves feature
Post Sharing
Direct messaging
Enhanced profiles
The following system
Activity feed
Better commenting (replies, editing)
Basic analytics dashboard
Admin Portal





Phase 3 (ML Integration):

Post recommendations
Content quality scoring
Content similarity detection
User preference learning
Image recognition for food photos
Trend prediction
